		Nature! We are surrounded and embraced by her:
		powerless to separate ourselves from her,
		and powerless to penetrate beyond her.
		Without asking or warning, she snatches us
		up into her circling dance, and whirls
		us on until we are tired and drop from her arms.
		She is ever shaping new forms: what is,
		has never yet been; what has been, comes not again.
		Everything is new, and yet nought but the old
